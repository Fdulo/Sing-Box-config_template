# Introduction
[中文文档](https://github.com/Fdulo/Sing-Box-config_template/blob/main/README_ZH-CN.md)

This is my personal **sing-box** configuration template, which can be used directly with [sing-box-subscribe](https://github.com/Toperlock/sing-box-subscribe).

# Features

- Designed to minimize DNS leaks
- Supports split routing for a limited number of Chinese websites
- Some templates enable inbound **mixed** and **HTTP** proxies

The available **sing-box** template versions include:
- **1.11**: supports `realip` and `fakeip`
- **1.12**: supports `realip` and `fakeip`  

>**Recommendation: use version 1.11**, as version 1.12 is still in early development and may have several issues.

# Afterword

There is no perfect rule—only the rule that suits your needs. Feel free to modify it as required.

Your suggestions for improvements are highly welcomed!
