# Introduction

This is my personal **sing-box** configuration template, which can be used directly with [sing-box-subscribe](https://github.com/Toperlock/sing-box-subscribe).

# Features

- Designed to minimize DNS leaks
- Supports split routing for a limited number of Chinese websites
- Some templates enable inbound **mixed** and **HTTP** proxies

# Afterword

The available **sing-box** template versions include:
- **1.11**: supports `realip` and `fakeip`
- **1.12**: supports `realip` and `fakeip`  

**Recommendation: use version 1.11**, as version 1.12 is still in early development and may have several issues.

There is no perfect rule—only the rule that suits your needs. Feel free to modify it as required.

Your suggestions for improvements are highly welcomed!
