Introduction

This is my personal sing-box configuration template, which can be used directly with sing-box-subscribe.

Features

Minimizes DNS leaks

Routes a small number of Chinese sites directly

Some templates enable inbound mixed & HTTP proxy

Suggestions for improvements are always welcome


Available sing-box Template Versions

> Recommended: 1.11, as 1.12 is still in early development and may have more issues.



Final Thoughts

There is no perfect ruleâ€”only rules that suit your needs.
Feel free to modify the template to better fit your use case.
